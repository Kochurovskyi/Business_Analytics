Question 4-1:
Identify any fields you think might be PII, CFI, CPNI, 
or PHI as we defined in Module 4, Video 4

Answer 4-1:
In my business model I see no personal information or something related to private,

Question 4-2:
What data elements in your model will present the most significant data quality challenges? 
Explain your reasoning.

Answer 4-2:
Most sensitive data in my model where mistakes can appear it’s quantities, 
dates, and names (candy). It’s permanent flow data which should be entered by people.
Most mistakes are made in the world by people, not computer calculations.
