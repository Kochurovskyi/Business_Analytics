## Marketing campaign strategy. Promoting financial products to bank customers

In previous 4 years, a retail bank sold several products (mortgage account, savings account, and pension account) to its customers. It kept records of all historical data, and this data is available for analysis and reuse. Following a merger in 2021, the bank has new customers and wants to launch some marketing campaigns.

The budget for the campaigns is limited. The bank wants to contact a customer and propose only one product.

The marketing department needs to decide:

Who should be contacted?
Which product should be proposed? (Proposing too many products is counter productive, so only one product per customer contact will be proposed).
How will a customer be contacted? There are different ways, with different costs and efficiency.
How can they optimally use their limited budget?
Will such campaigns be profitable?
